                This one is about my life with a tube. After getting released
                from the hospital for an appendicitis infection, they left a
                drain in me for THREEE WHOLE WEEKS. It was annoying as shit but
                I got over it.

                This one is about the book <em>Shoe Dog</em> by Phil Knight, the
                Nike founder. It is an amazing Book about the beginnings of Nike
                and it shows what it takes to start a business, keep it alive,
                and grow it into something great. Truly inspiring and I feel
                like it gave me a better understanding of business.

                This one is about my 100 Days of Code. I am almost done--70 days
                in! But once I finish, I am going to write a reflection on what
                this 100 days of code has taught me about myself, the way I
                think, my interests, and whether I'm going to stick with it or
                not.

                This one is about running. I miss running. My body has a love
                and hate relationship with running. I've come to enjoy it.
                Running makes me feel good. But my body constantly breaks down
                and gets injured. Right now, I'm starting from the ground up and
                hope to be able to strengthen myself, so that I can run
                consistently.

              <p>
                This one is about entering my final year of university.
                Especially now that I know I'm graduating on time. It is
                terrifying thinking about entering the workforce and the lack of
                free time I will have from now on. It makes me question what I
                want to do with my life. How will I start my own business?

                This one is about Peanut Butter Overnight Oats. I made them for
                the first time the other day and it was amazing. I've made good
                overnight oats before with chocolate or vanilla protein powder
                (I don't use fruits because I feel weird about eating fruit with
                yogurt), but these peanut butter oats are way better. But that's
                also just because I LOVE peanut butter.
